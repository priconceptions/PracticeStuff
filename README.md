# PracticeStuff
Just some algorithms/data structures practicing

### Welcome to my practice space!

I am using this repo to keep track of everything I am doing to improve my data structures and algorithms skills.

I am using CTCI and LeetCode right now and will probably progress to something else in the future.

Thanks for stopping by!
